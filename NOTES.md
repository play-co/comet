# Known Feature Issues

* Multi-selection undo does not reset gizmo transform correctly, it resets it
    - May need to store transform gizmo state with each command in undo stack?
    - Also need a way to recalculate multi-transform gizmo when remote nodes move
* Empty (Container) icon needs to be selectable, but not scale with viewport
    - Also needs to select all children, not itself when clicked so transform gizmo can manipulate

# Enhancements

* Box Selection could white border highlight nodes as they are being dragged over and out

# Known General Issues

* Not on latest Pixi
    - on 6, upgrade to 7 has breaking changes around event handling
* Git hooks disabled
