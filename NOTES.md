# Known Feature Issues or Edge Cases

* Multi-selection undo does not reset gizmo transform correctly, it resets it
    - May need to store transform gizmo state with each command in undo stack?
    - Also need a way to recalculate multi-transform gizmo when remote nodes move
* Empty (Container) icon needs to be selectable, but not scale with viewport
    - Also needs to select all children, not itself when clicked so transform gizmo can manipulate
* Resizing viewport needs updating 3rd party lib, interactivity breaks outside new area

# Enhancements

* Git hooks disabled
* Local development only working in Chrome, possibly due to no certificate for wss://

# Major Missing Features
