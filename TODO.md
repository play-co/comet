* Experiment first with basic Pixi parent/child setup using worldTransforms to create local transforms
    - Get a good idea of how parenting might work later
* Figure out interactive functionality separate to using transforms to control gizmo, but favour transform multiplication for updating selected objects
* Master pivot!
